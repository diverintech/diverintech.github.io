    "aboutMeText": "My name is Joana, I live in Portugal, and I graduated with a master’s degree in Physics Engineering from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. After my studies, I couldn’t find opportunities in the field, so I decided to pursue programming, which allowed me to complement my knowledge with technology. Each project has given me the chance to learn new tools, so I decided to apply some of my knowledge to create this online resume. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling (who doesn’t?), playing escape games, gardening, and testing new gadgets. Want to know more? Then reach out to me on LinkedIn.",
